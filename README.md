# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to perform an analysis for Bobby at Pewlett Hackard, on an extremely large set of data for over 300k employees at the company. The company wanted to reveiw its staffing metrics because they are planning for a large scale exit of their work force. This large scale exit will be determined using the data wrangling skills we provided to help the company who is and who might be eligible for retirement. We also provided further data on a mentoring program to help the company set up their next group of leaders.

## Results

- Of the 300,024 employees at PH, 90,398 or 30% are eligible for retirement based on their standards

### Employees Eligible for Mentorship
- With such a large percent of the company eligible to retire we have provided some insight into which employee positions have the most eligible employees for mentorship. In doing this we have found the amoount of employees available for mentorship.

### Summary
Based on our findings above Pewlett Hackard is facing a worst case scenario of losing 30% of their workforce, around 90k employees. Those specific positions within the company that have the highest amount of elibile employees to retire have an alarmingly low number of eligible mentorships to replace the exiting work force. PH will face a massive deficit if the employees choose to retire. I highly suggest they go look into the labor force for new available employees and go on a hiring surge.
